## Project steps & associated code:
0. **Initialization and setup**
   - Description: Setting up the necessary environment, libraries, and tools.

1. **Electric field analysis of uniform disk charge distribution**
   - Approach: FFT open-boundary and analytical.
   - Specifics:
     - The charge distribution is modeled as a uniform disk.
     - A circular geometry is utilized for the chamber and the charge distribution.

   - [View result](./results/01_1.png)

2. **Electric field analysis of Gaussian charge distribution**
   - Approach: FFT open-boundary and analytical(Round beam).
   - Specifics:
     - Gaussian distribution had a standard deviation half of the uniform disk charge.
     - The Gaussian distribution in this step utilizes the same standard deviation (sigma) for both x and y axes, making it symmetric.

   - [View result](./results/02_1.png)

3. **Semi-analytic approach on Gaussian charge distribution**
   - Approach: Baseeti-Erskien formula was applied.
   - Specifics: Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation half of the uniform disk charge.
   - [view code](./src/03_gaussian_semi_analytic.py)
   - [View result](./results/03_1.png)
   - **Notes:**
     - In process `03`, an elliptical geometry was introduced for both the chamber and the charge distribution.
     - Introduced `shape_factor` for elliptical shaping of the charge distribution and chamber.
     - Due to the introduction of the elliptical geometry, parameters like chamber radius and charge radius are now defined distinctly for the x and y axes.
     - This process requires `scipy.special` for the `wofz` function used in the Bassetti-Erskine method.


4. **Electric field study using FDSW on uniform charge distribution**
   - Approach: Shortley-Weller finite difference method (FDSW) and FFT.
   - [view code](./src/04_uniform_fdsw.py)
   - [View result](./results/04_1.png)
   - **Notes:**
     - While process `03` introduced an elliptical geometry, in process `04`, we chose to revert back to a spherical model.
     - The decision to transition back was influenced by some challenges and unanticipated results associated with the elliptical model in process `03`.
     - The spherical geometry, defined by `shape factor` set to 1, was employed for both the chamber and the charge distribution. The framework remains adaptable for future explorations into elliptical models.
     - We recognize the significance of the elliptical model and believe that it has potential for more detailed investigation. However, for the immediate goals of this study and in light of the time constraints, the spherical model was deemed more suitable.
     - Introduced `y_offset` to adjust the vertical position of the charge distribution's origin, aiming to gain insights into the boundary effects on the field.

5. **Electric field study using FDSW on Gaussian charge distribution**
   - Approach: Shortley-Weller finite difference method (FDSW) and FFT.
   - Specifics: Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation half of the uniform disk charge.
   - Other setup are the same as 4.

## Project Report ðŸ“„
A comprehensive report detailing the methodologies, findings, and conclusions of the summer school project has been included in this repository.

- **File Name**: `Report.pdf`
- **Project title**: Electric Field Computation from Particle Distributions: A Study of Boundary Effects
- **Project abstract**: This study examines the influence of boundaries on electric fields arising from uniform and Gaussian particle distributions within accelerators like the SIS100 at FAIR. Initial investigations were conducted without considering boundaries, progressing to scenarios that incorporate boundary considerations. Findings highlight computational challenges in Gaussian distributions and emphasize the importance of symmetrical configurations in bounded settings. The research underscores the necessity for efficient field computation methods in real-world accelerator contexts.
